Algorithms Course 1
=================

This project contains implementation of different algorithms and data structures I studied during Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 course by Tim Roughgarden on Coursera.

Algorithms implemented:
Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Karger's Minimum Cut, Dijkstra's Shortest Path.

Problems solved:
Counting inversions in an array, Finding Strongly Connected Components, Finding 2-Sum, Median maintenance in a stream of elements.

Data structures implemented:
Heap (Priority Queue), MultiValue Dictionary (MultiValue HashMap).

Language: C#

For Cursera students:
Remember that your knowledge is more important than your Cursera grades.
Implementing all these algorithms is really a lot of fun.
